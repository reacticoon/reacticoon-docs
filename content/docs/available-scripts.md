In the project directory, you can run:

## `yarn start`

It will runs the app in development mode on the [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) local url.

## `yarn run build`

It will builds the app for production. The build is optimized for the best performances.
All you have to do is deploy the `build` directory.

See the [create-react-app section about deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

## `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the [create-react-app section about running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
