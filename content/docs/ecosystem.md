This page is an overview of the Reacticoon ecosystem documentation and related resources.

_Reacticoon_ is an JavaScript ecosystem for React and Redux.

Reacticoon ecosystem works on two sides:

- on the application side, with 'reacticoon', allowing you to create your Redux application.
- on the command line side, providing compilation configuration, commands and code generation. [Learn more](./reacticoon-cli-configuration).

Begin with Reacticoon by learning to [create a new project](./reacticoon-create-project).
